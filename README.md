# Cluster-Analysis-of-Baltimore-City-Data

**Business Question**: Baltimore is notorious for being a segmented city. As a policy maker, it is essential to understand how these segments are different from one another, in order to implement policy that best suits a particular community within Baltimore’s needs.Thus, my business question using this lens is the following: how are Baltimore city’s different census tracts clustered by household income, teenage birth rates, incarceration rates and employment rates?

Based on the business question the following **data analysis** questions could be posed:
1. How much variability exists between Baltimore neighborhoods? (as expressed by the number of standard deviations from the mean)
2. Which input values show the greatest variability amongst neighborhoods in Baltimore?
3. Which factors in Baltimore neighborhoods seem to be related? (ex: higher than average household income and lower than average incarceration rates in one cluster, vs the opposite in another.)

Based on my analysis, I was able to organize Baltimore into five clusters as cited below:
1. Baltimore MD (79 tracts): slightly lower than average incarceration rates, household income and employment rates. Average teenage birth rates.
2. South Gate, Glen Burnie, MD (137 tracts): slightly lower than average incarceration and teenage birth rates, fairly high household income and employment rates.
3. Frankford Baltimore, MD (66 tracts): slightly higher than average incarceration and teenage birth rates, fairly low household income, average employment rates.
4. Catonsville, MD (50 tracts): low incarceration and teenage birth rates, quite high income and employment rates.
5. East Baltimore Midway, Baltimore (85 tracts): high incarceration and teenage birth rates, low household income and employment rates.

What I can **conclude** from my analysis is: 
1. Baltimore is in fact a segmented city. The variation isn’t stratified to be deemed unusual, as it all remains under two standard deviations of the mean for each input/cluster, but, there is great variety nonetheless.
2. The largest cluster is made up of cluster 2, which has fairly positive data, and, when added to cluster 5 (with the most positive data) this lets policy makers hone in on the heavily disenfranchised neighborhoods, such as cluster 5, which holds census 85 tracts.
3. Some data seems to go together within and throughout the tracts, higher household income and higher employment rates, tend to go along with low incarceration and teenage birth rates. 

To answer my business question, this cluster analysis provides great insight to Baltimore city, as it confirms a policy maker of two things. Firstly, that Baltimore is in fact segmented, and thus city wide programs, may not be as effective as targeting particular areas based on their specific needs. Secondly, it shows that programs that stimulate employment and raising household income, could potentially have a strong effect on decreasing incarceration rates and teenage birth rates.
